AEIDS
=====

AEIDS is a prototype of anomaly-based intrusion detection system which works by remembering the pattern of legitimate network traffic using Autoencoder. The full paper of this approach (Unsupervised Approach for Detecting Low Rate Attacks on Network Traffic with Autoencoder) is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8560678)
